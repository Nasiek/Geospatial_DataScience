# Geospatial_DataScience
projects for Geospatial Data Science in Python


This is a collection of assignments for the MUSA 620 course Geospatial Data Science. The repo will be updated with more details 
about trouble shooting but the plan is to create interactive binder notebooks. That link will be posted [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Nasiek/Geospatial_DataScience/master?urlpath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNasiek%2FGeospatial_DataScience%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fassignment-3-Pt1.ipynb). I intend to fill out the respective links to each assignment here to make it easy for viewers to just see individual projects. They'll also be connected to my larger portfolio.
